Environment 

Chrome 93.0.4577.63 (Official Build) (x86_64)
Mac OS Catalina 10.15.17



TEST CASES

1. Drop down 
    1. Drop down responds to click
    2. Drop down values: 
        2.1. Group by Function
        2.2. Group by Role
    3. Upon changing the value, the display in the drop-down changes as well


Tabs: Ability to toggle between Gender and Race

Gender tab containers: 
- Pay Equity Gap 
- Employees in Comparison
- Budget



Zoom

Resize browser

Accessibility - none for shortcuts and didnâ€™t check for speech




BUGS
1. Group by Function drop down 
*** Group By Function option greyed out and, if I get this right, we want to have access to that option as well

1. Group by Function drop-down 
2. Look for the drop down options
*** Change Group - has no logical meaning to be there, unless in itself creates another grouping, but that is inactive and I see no references to it

1. Group by Function drop-down 
2. Choose Group by Role
*** The display is left to Group by Function and should change to Group by Role




CONSIDERATIONS
I would have to understand the context of this dashboard, so I made a lot of presumptions and the test cases are based on those presumptions.

Json identical between Roles and Function, just different values. Is that supposed to happen?

Inspect for visual elements

Network tab for errors and the GET


Budget - color 666 vs 666666

The tabs are not particularly visible on a bad vision or older monitor

Responsive design - can use the Console in Chrome and play with some devices

In the console use Lighthouse to generate a report
